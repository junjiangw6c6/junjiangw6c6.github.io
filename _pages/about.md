ðŸŒ¿ Iâ€™m a PhD student at Yale Universityâ€™s School of the Environment. My research focuses on quantifying the impacts of the urban environmentâ€”such as greenspace, air pollution, and climate stressorsâ€”on public health outcomes.

According to the UN, by 2050 more than 68% of the worldâ€™s population will live in cities. Thatâ€™s exciting, but it also raises an urgent question: are we truly prepared for this shift, given escalating health challenges and more frequent extreme weather events?

The good news: we still have time to change course. With smarter planning, bolder imagination, and more sustainable choices, we can create urban environments that support healthier, happier, and more resilient communities.

So letâ€™s dream bigger, plan smarter, and build cities that are truly sustainable! ðŸŒ±âœ¨
